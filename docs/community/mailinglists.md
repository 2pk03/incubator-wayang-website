# Mailing List

Mailing list is where we discuss in public and keep everything tracked. You are welcomed to subscribe it if you wish:

- To be informed about bug reports or feature requests. 
- To discuss developing plans or specific issues. 
- To offer helps to those who ask questions by email.
- Give us ideas to make Wayang better for you and all the community.

The emails where you can get subscribe are:
* [dev@wayang.apache.org](mailto:dev@wayang.apache.org) holds other general discussions.
* [commits@wayang.apache.org ](mailto:commits@wayang.apache.org )focuses on the commit logs.

## How to subscribe to a mailing list

Send an email without any contents or subject to LISTNAME-subscribe@wayang.apache.org. (replace LISTNAME with dev, commits, ..)
    Wait till you receive an email with the subject “confirm subscribe to LISTNAME@wayang.apache.org”. Reply to that email, without editing the subject or including any contents
    Wait till you receive an email with the subject “WELCOME to LISTNAME@wayang.apache.org”.

If you send us an email with a code snippet, make sure that:

* you do not link to files in external services as such files can change, get deleted, or the link might break and thus make an archived email thread useless 
* you paste text instead of screenshots of text 
* you keep formatting when pasting code in order to keep the code readable 
* there are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities
* if you are using some platform, please specify the version
