There is an urgent need for unifying data analytics as more and more
application tasks become more complex: Nowadays, it is normal to
see tasks performing data preparation, analytical processing, and
machine learning operations in a single pipeline. Despite this need,
achieving this is still a dreadful process where developers have to
get familiar with many data processing platforms and write ad hoc
scripts for integrating them. This tutorial is motivated by this need
from both academia and industry. We will discuss the importance
of unifying data processing as well as the current efforts to achieve
it. In particular, we will introduce a classification of the different
cases where an application needs or benefits from data analytics
unification and discuss the challenges in each case. Along with this
classification, we will also present current efforts known up to date
that aim at unifying data processing, such as Apache Beam and
Apache Wayang, and emphasize their differences. We will conclude
with open problems and their challenges.
